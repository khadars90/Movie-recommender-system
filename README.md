# Movie-Recommender-System  
A simple movie recommendation engine built in Python, combining exploratory data analysis, modeling and a web interface.

## 🎬 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates how to build a movie recommendation system using publicly available movie datasets and serve it via a lightweight web app. You’ll find:

- A Jupyter Notebook (`Movie-recommender-system.ipynb`) that walks through data preparation, analysis, feature engineering, model building and evaluation.  
- A Python web application (`app.py`) that loads the trained model and allows users to get movie recommendations via a web interface.

The goal is to illustrate the end-to-end pipeline: data → model → interface.

## 🔧 Key Components  
### 1. Data & Notebook  
- `Movie-recommender-system.ipynb` — contains:  
  - Data loading and cleaning  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualise distributions, genres, ratings etc.  
  - Feature engineering (e.g., creating user‐movie matrices, sparse representations)  
  - Training a recommendation model (could be collaborative filtering / content-based / hybrid)  
  - Model evaluation and validation  
- Datasets (if included in repository or referenced externally) — ensure you have the correct license.

### 2. Web App  
- `app.py` — a Flask (or similar) web application that:  
  - loads the trained recommendation model and any supporting files  
  - accepts user input (e.g., a movie title or user profile)  
  - returns movie recommendations  
  - renders results in a simple UI.

## 🚀 Getting Started  
### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.x  
- Key libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `scipy`, `flask`, etc. (see `requirements.txt` if provided)  
- Internet access if any dataset or API is fetched online

### Installation & Run  
1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khadars90/Movie-recommender-system.git  
   cd Movie-recommender-system
